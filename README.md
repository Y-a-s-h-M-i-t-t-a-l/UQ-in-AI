# Uncertainty of a model prediction using IBM UQ360 toolkit

The project depicts on a hands-on to using the toolkit for both Regression and Classification tasks.
 
It highlights how can you train an intrinsic model with UQ capabilities or build extrinsic model on top of an existing model to find it's Uncertainty. Moreover, it allows callibration for the same, using a powerful metric named Uncertainty Characteristics Curve.

The report attached bring in a detailed view of UQ concepts and it's implementation.
